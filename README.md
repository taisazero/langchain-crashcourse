## What is Langchain?
Langchain is a library for building LLM applications. It is built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [HuggingFace's Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) libraries, and language model inference API such as the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api).
