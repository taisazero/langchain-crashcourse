## What is Langchain?
Langchain is a library for building LLM applications. It is built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [HuggingFace's Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) libraries, and language model inference API such as the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api).

## Installation
To setup for this crash course, you will need to install the following:
1. Anacoda (or Miniconda) [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)
2. Then create a new environment with the following command:
```
conda create -n langchain python=3.8
```
3. Activate the environment:
```
conda activate langchain
```
4. Install langchain:
```
pip install langchain
```
5. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/taisazero/langchain-crashcourse.git
```

## Building a Simple LLM Application
Go to the [notebook](Insert link here) to access this section of the crash course.

## Final Lab Project
In this small project you will build 🤗**HuggingTutor** ,  an LLM-based application that can answer questions, help resolve errors, and write tutorials about HuggingFace's Transformers library accurately by retrieving answers from the library's documentation.
