    "In this lab, we will be building a simple langchain agent that can use a set of pre-defined tools. We will experiment with adding and removing tools and observe model robustness. At the end of this notebook, we will put our agent together in a chainlit web interface.\n",

You are also allowed to ask the TA's and the instructor for help during the class. Please do so if you get stuck and aim to finish the lab within the class time."
