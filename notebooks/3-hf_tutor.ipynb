It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to\\n70B parameters, with checkpoints finetuned for chat application! The abstract\\nfrom the paper is the following: In this work, we develop and release Llama 2,\\na collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging\\nin scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called\\nLlama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform\\nopen-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human\\nevaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for\\nclosed-source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to\\nfine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the\\ncommunity to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development\\nof LLMs. Checkout all Llama2 models here The Llama2 models were trained using\\nbfloat16, but the original inference uses float16. The checkpoints uploaded on\\nthe hub use torch_dtype = ‘float16’which will be used by theAutoModelAPI to\\ncast the checkpoints fromtorch.float32totorch.float16`. The dtype of the\\nonline weights is mostly irrelevant, unless you are using torch_dtype=\"auto\"\\nwhen initializing a model using model =\\nAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"path\", torch_dtype = \"auto\"). The reason\\nis that the model will first be downloaded ( using the dtype of the\\ncheckpoints online) then it will be casted to the default dtype of torch\\n(becomes torch.float32) and finally, if there is a torch_dtype provided in the\\nconfig, it will be used. Training the model in float16 is not recommended and\\nknown to produce nan, as such the model should be trained in bfloat16. Tips:\\nWeights for the Llama2 models can be obtained by filling out this form The\\narchitecture is very similar to the first Llama, with the addition of Grouped\\nQuery Attention (GQA) following this paper Setting config.pretraining_tp to a\\nvalue different than 1 will activate the more accurate but slower computation\\nof the linear layers, which should better match the original logits. The\\noriginal model uses pad_id = -1 which means that there is no padding token. We\\ncan’t have the same logic, make sure to add a padding token using\\ntokenizer.add_special_tokens({\"pad_token\":\"\"}) and resize the token embedding\\naccordingly. You should also set the model.config.pad_token_id.

The largest version of GPT-2, for example, has a fixed length of 1024\\ntokens, so we cannot calculate pθ(xt∣x This is quick to compute since the\\nperplexity of each segment can be computed in one forward pass, but serves as\\na poor approximation of the fully-factorized perplexity and will typically\\nyield a higher (worse) PPL because the model will have less context at most of\\nthe prediction steps. Instead, the PPL of fixed-length models should be\\nevaluated with a sliding-window strategy. This involves repeatedly sliding the\\ncontext window so that the model has more context when making each prediction.\\nThis is a closer approximation to the true decomposition of the sequence\\nprobability and will typically yield a more favorable score. The downside is\\nthat it requires a separate forward pass for each token in the corpus. A good\\npractical compromise is to employ a strided sliding window, moving the context\\nby larger strides rather than sliding by 1 token a time. This allows\\ncomputation to proceed much faster while still giving the model a large\\ncontext to make predictions at each step. Example: Calculating perplexity with\\nGPT-2 in 🤗 Transformers Let’s demonstrate this process with GPT-2. Copied from\\ntransformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2TokenizerFast device = \"cuda\"\\nmodel_id = \"gpt2-large\" model =\\nGPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_id).to(device) tokenizer =\\nGPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained(model_id) We’ll load in the WikiText-2\\ndataset and evaluate the perplexity using a few different sliding-window\\nstrategies. Since this dataset is small and we’re just doing one forward pass\\nover the set, we can just load and encode the entire dataset in memory. Copied\\nfrom datasets import load_dataset test = load_dataset(\"wikitext\",\\n\"wikitext-2-raw-v1\", split=\"test\") encodings =\\ntokenizer(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(test[\"text\"]), return_tensors=\"pt\") With 🤗 Transformers,\\nwe can simply pass the input_ids as the labels to our model, and the average\\nnegative log-likelihood for each token is returned as the loss. With our\\nsliding window approach, however, there is overlap in the tokens we pass to\\nthe model at each iteration. We don’t want the log-likelihood for the tokens\\nwe’re just treating as context to be included in our loss, so we can set these\\ntargets to -100 so that they are ignored. The following is an example of how\\nwe could do this with a stride of 512. This means that the model will have at\\nleast 512 tokens for context when calculating the conditional likelihood of\\nany one token (provided there are 512 preceding tokens available to condition\\non). Copied import torch from tqdm import tqdm max_length =\\nmodel.config.n_positions stride = 512 seq_len = encodings.input_ids.size(1)\\nnlls = [] prev_end_loc = 0 for begin_loc in tqdm(range(0, seq_len, stride)):\\nend_loc = min(begin_loc + max_length, seq_len) trg_len = end_loc -\\nprev_end_loc # may be different from stride on last loop input_ids =\\nencodings.input_ids[:, begin_loc:end_loc].to(device) target_ids =\\ninput_ids.clone() target_ids[:, :-trg_len] = -100 with torch.no_grad():\\noutputs = model(input_ids, labels=target_ids) # loss is calculated using\\nCrossEntropyLoss which averages over valid labels # N.B. the model only\\ncalculates loss over trg_len - 1 labels, because it internally shifts the\\nlabels # to the left by 1. neg_log_likelihood = outputs.loss\\nnlls.append(neg_log_likelihood) prev_end_loc = end_loc if end_loc == seq_len:\\nbreak ppl = torch.exp(torch.stack(nlls).mean()) Running this with the stride\\nlength equal to the max input length is equivalent to the suboptimal, non-\\nsliding-window strategy we discussed above.
